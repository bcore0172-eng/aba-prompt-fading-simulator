# ABA Prompt Fading Simulator

This project is an interactive simulator designed to demonstrate prompt fading techniques commonly used in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). It models how prompts are gradually reduced as a learner gains independence with a skill.

## Features
- Simulates different levels of prompting
- Demonstrates gradual prompt fading
- Designed for educational and training purposes
- Simple, interactive interface

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works
The simulator presents a task that begins with higher levels of prompting. As the user progresses, prompts are systematically reduced to reflect standard ABA prompt fading strategies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

No additional setup required.

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning and demonstration tool for understanding ABA prompt fading concepts. It is not intended to replace formal training or clinical supervision.

## Future Improvements
- Add multiple prompt fading strategies
- Track user progress
- Improve visual feedback and animations
